### Question 5

For this question use the reprex function discussed in lecture for each of the variable assignments.

Create four variables to represent the 2x2 table in Question 2. We suggest using a, b, c, and d to match the 2x2 format.

Using these variables, calculate the odds ratio again and assign it to a new variable.

```{r question_5}
# your code here
```
